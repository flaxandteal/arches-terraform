# Full scan is more aggressive, so:
failonwarn=false          # Donâ€™t fail just on warnings
failonerror=true          # Fail if there are errors
maxalerts=2000            # Higher max alerts since full scan finds more issues

# Ignore some noisy alerts (e.g. outdated libraries, info-level alerts)
# ignore=10010              # Example rule ID to ignore (adjust as needed)

# You can add more ignores if you want to reduce noise:
# ignore=10010,10021,10022

# Enable more extensive scanning rules if desired (usually default)
