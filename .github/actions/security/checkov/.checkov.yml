# Checkov Configuration for Terraform Security Scanning (GCP)
# Maintainer Notes:
# - This config is tailored for GCP Terraform projects.
# - To skip checks: add to `skip_check` (e.g., CKV_GCP_30 for GCS bucket uniform access).
# - To exclude files/folders: add to `skip_path` (e.g., .github/, modules/legacy/).
# - CI filters HIGH/CRITICAL issues separately — do not add severity filtering here.
# - Use in-line suppressions for specific resources: "checkov:skip=<check_id>:<reason>".
# - Common GCP checks to consider skipping (if needed):
#   - CKV_GCP_18: Public IP on Compute Engine (if public IPs are intentional).
#   - CKV_GCP_66: Default service account usage (if legacy workflows require it).

skip_check:
  #- CKV_GCP_30        # GCS bucket should have uniform bucket-level access enabled
  # Optional additional skips (uncomment if needed):
  # - CKV_GCP_18      # Ensure Compute Engine instances do not have public IP
  # - CKV_GCP_66      # Avoid default service account for GKE/Compute Engine

skip_path:
  - .github/          # Exclude GitHub Actions workflows

# Enable in-line suppressions in .tf files
suppress_comment: "checkov:skip=<check_id>:<reason>"

# Optional: Restrict to Terraform framework (recommended for clarity)
